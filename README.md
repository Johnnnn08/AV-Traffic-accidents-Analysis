# AV-Traffic-accidents-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data. 
We download the dataset from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and various machine learning models to predict accident severity and analyze feature importance. 
The analysis is performed using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
